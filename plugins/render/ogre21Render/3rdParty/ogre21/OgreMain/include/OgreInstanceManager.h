        Each InstanceManager can control one technique and one mesh, but it can manage
        multiple materials at the same time.
        @see SceneManager::createInstanceManager, which creates this InstanceManager. Each one
        must have a unique name. It's wasteless to create two InstanceManagers with the same
        mesh reference, instancing technique and instances per batch count.
        This class takes care of managing batches automatically, so that more are created when
        needed, and reuse existing ones as much as possible; thus the user doesn't have to worry
        of managing all those low level issues.
        @see InstanceBatch & @see InstanceEntity for more information.

            time. You want this to be false if you now you're entities are moving very
