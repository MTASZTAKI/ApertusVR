======================

Simple SDK Usage Project : show how to get the axes values out of the 3dRudder and get statuses.

When you'll start this sample, it will print the AxesParam you are using to get the values from the 3dRudder,
then the axes values and finally the 3dRudder status.

You can hit the '-' or '+' key at any time to switch the AxesParam and choose between :
- Reference angle
- Normalized Linear
- Default

You can then hit 'q' key to stop the execution.
