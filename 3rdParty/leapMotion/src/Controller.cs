     * The supported policy flags are:
     *
     * **POLICY_BACKGROUND_FRAMES** -- requests that your application receives frames
     *   when it is not the foreground application for user input.
     *
     *   The background frames policy determines whether an application
     *   receives frames of tracking data while in the background. By
     *   default, the Leap Motion  software only sends tracking data to the foreground application.
     *   Only applications that need this ability should request the background
     *   frames policy. The "Allow Background Apps" checkbox must be enabled in the
     *   Leap Motion Control Panel or this policy will be denied.
     *
     * **POLICY_OPTIMIZE_HMD** -- request that the tracking be optimized for head-mounted
     *   tracking.
     *
     *   The optimize HMD policy improves tracking in situations where the Leap
     *   Motion hardware is attached to a head-mounted display. This policy is
     *   not granted for devices that cannot be mounted to an HMD, such as
     *   Leap Motion controllers embedded in a laptop or keyboard.
     *
     * Some policies can be denied if the user has disabled the feature on
     * their Leap Motion control panel.
