Package contents:

    * Client software installer -- Installs the Leap Motion drivers and
                                   service/daemon software.

    * Leap Motion SDK           -- Contains the header files and code libraries
                                   for creating native Leap Motion-enabled
                                   applications. Also contains documentation
