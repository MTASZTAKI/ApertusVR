          "desc": "<p>Throughout the documentation are indications of a section&#39;s\nstability. The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it\nmatures, certain parts are more reliable than others. Some are so\nproven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at\nall. Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous\nand in the process of being redesigned.</p>\n<p>The stability indices are as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 0 - Deprecated. This feature is known to be problematic, and changes\nmay be planned. Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings to be\nemitted. Backwards compatibility across major versions should not be expected.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 1 - Experimental. This feature is still under active development and\nsubject to non-backwards compatible changes, or even removal, in any future\nversion. Use of the feature is not recommended in production environments.\nExperimental features are not subject to the Node.js Semantic Versioning model.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-txt\">Stability: 2 - Stable. The API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the\nnpm ecosystem is a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely\nnecessary.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Caution must be used when making use of <code>Experimental</code> features, particularly\nwithin modules that may be used as dependencies (or dependencies of\ndependencies) within a Node.js application. End users may not be aware that\nexperimental features are being used, and therefore may experience unexpected\nfailures or behavior changes when API modifications occur. To help avoid such\nsurprises, <code>Experimental</code> features may require a command-line flag to\nexplicitly enable them, or may cause a process warning to be emitted.\nBy default, such warnings are printed to <a href=\"process.html#process_process_stderr\"><code>stderr</code></a> and may be handled by\nattaching a listener to the <a href=\"process.html#process_event_warning\"><code>&#39;warning&#39;</code></a> event.</p>\n"

The docs link to the corresponding man\npages (short for manual pages) which describe how the syscalls work.</p>\n<p>Some syscalls, like lchown(2), are BSD-specific. That means, for\nexample, that <a href=\"fs.html#fs_fs_lchown_path_uid_gid_callback\"><code>fs.lchown()</code></a> only works on macOS and other BSD-derived\nsystems, and is not available on Linux.</p>\n<p>Most Unix syscalls have Windows equivalents, but behavior may differ on Windows\nrelative to Linux and macOS.
