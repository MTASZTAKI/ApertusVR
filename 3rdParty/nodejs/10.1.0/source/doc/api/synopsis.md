`node [options] [V8 options] [script.js | -e "script" | - ] [arguments]`

Please see the [Command Line Options][] document for information about
different options and ways to run scripts with Node.js.

## Example
An example of a [web server][] written with Node.js which responds with
`'Hello World!'`:

Commands displayed in this document are shown starting with `$` or `>`
to replicate how they would appear in a user's terminal.
Do not include the `$` and `>` character they are there to
indicate the start of each command.

There are many tutorials and examples that follow this
convention: `$` or `>` for commands run as a regular user, and `#`
for commands that should be executed as an administrator.

Lines that donâ€™t start with `$` or `>` character are typically showing
the output of the previous command.

Firstly, make sure to have downloaded and installed Node.js.
See [this guide][] for further install information.

Now, create an empty project folder called `projects`, navigate into it:
Project folder can be named base on user's current project title but
this example will use `projects` as the project folder.

Linux and Mac:

```console
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
```

Windows CMD:

```console
> mkdir %USERPROFILE%\projects
> cd %USERPROFILE%\projects
```

Windows PowerShell:

```console
> mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\projects
> cd $env:USERPROFILE\projects
```

Next, create a new source file in the `projects`
 folder and call it `hello-world.js`.

In Node.js it is considered good style to use
hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) to separate
 multiple words in filenames.

Open `hello-world.js` in any preferred text editor and
paste in the following content.

```js
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

Save the file, go back to the terminal window enter the following command:

```console
$ node hello-world.js
```

An output like this should appear in the terminal to indicate Node.js
server is running:

```console
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Now, open any preferred web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

If the browser displays the string `Hello, world!`, that indicates
the server is working.

Many of the examples in the documentation can be run similarly.
