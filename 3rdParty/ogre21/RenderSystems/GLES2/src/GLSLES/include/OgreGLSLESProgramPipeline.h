    /** Specialisation of HighLevelGpuProgram to provide support for OpenGL 
     Shader Language (GLSL ES) for OpenGL ES 2.0.
     @remarks
     GLSL ES has no target assembler or entry point specification like DirectX 9 HLSL.
     Vertex and Fragment shaders only have one entry point called "main".  
     When a shader is compiled, microcode is generated but can not be accessed by
     the application.
     GLSL ES also does not provide assembler low level output after compiling.  The GL ES Render
     system assumes that the Gpu program is a GL Gpu program so GLSLESProgramPipeline will create a 
     GLSLESGpuProgram that is subclassed from GLES2GpuProgram for the low level implementation.
     The GLES2Program class will create a shader and program object and compile the source but will
     not create a pipeline object.  It's up to GLES2GpuProgram class to request a program pipeline object
     to link the program object to.

     @note
     GLSL ES supports multiple modular shader objects that can be attached to one program
     object to form a single shader.  This is supported through the "attach" material script
     command.  All the modules to be attached are listed on the same line as the attach command
     separated by white space.
