    /** Ogre assumes that there are separate vertex and fragment programs to deal with but
        GLSL has one program object that represents the active vertex and fragment shader objects
        during a rendering state.  GLSL Vertex and fragment 
        shader objects are compiled separately and then attached to a program object and then the
        program object is linked.  Since Ogre can only handle one vertex program and one fragment
        program being active in a pass, the GLSL Link Program Manager does the same.  The GLSL Link
        program manager acts as a state machine and activates a program object based on the active
        vertex and fragment program.  Previously created program objects are stored along with a unique
        key in a hash_map for quick retrieval the next time the program object is required.
