        and provide an interface for GL3PlusRenderSystem calls.  GLSL does not provide access to the
        low level code of the shader so this class is really just a dummy place holder.
        GLSL uses a program object to represent the active vertex and fragment programs used
        but Ogre materials maintain separate instances of the active vertex and fragment programs
        which creates a small problem for GLSL integration.  The GLSLGpuProgram class provides the
        interface between the GLSLLinkProgramManager , GL3PlusRenderSystem, and the active GLSLProgram
        instances.
