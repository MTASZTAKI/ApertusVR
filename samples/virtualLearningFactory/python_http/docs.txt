To start up the server you simply need to run the http_server.py in python. 
If you are using command line write: python http_server.py
If you have everything installed, it will start and you will have nothing else to do.

requirements:
I used python 3.6.2, but is should work in 3.x and even with 2.x

package			installation:
http.server  		pip install httpserver
requests		pip install requests
